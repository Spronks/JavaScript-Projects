# JavaScript-Projects

* I'll be working on a series of projects in JavaScript to solidify my learning and practice my skills...
* At the same time I want to become more familiar with the workflow of Git and Github...

# Day 1 - Counter
I made a simple counter, with 3 buttons to increment, decrement and reset to 0. 

# Day 2 - Calculator
I made a simple calculator, capable of doing the basic operations and a clear button.

# Day 3 - Form Validation
I made a form with username, email and password as inputs and we are checking the validity of these inputs.
Username must be 8 letters long, email address should be in a valid form and password should be 8 characters long and must include owercase, uppercase, digits and special charachters. Also there is an extra password input and we make sure those two match.

# Day 4 - Navigation Bar
A hamburger icon thats toggles on and off a navbar.

# Day 5 - ToDo List
A ToDo list in which we can add and remove items.
